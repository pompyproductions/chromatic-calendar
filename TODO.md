## Info sidebar

- Click 1 on a calendar day registers the first date
- Info about this date is displayed on the "info" sidebar: date string, distance to today
- Click 2 on a calendar day registers the second date: if date is smaller than date 1, change order
- Info about both dates is displayed, as well as distance, workdays, weekends between them
